## Contents

This directory contains the scripts used for classical machine learning classifiers. These scripts were used as initial tests for the project to evaluate the performance of different algorithms on the dataset.
In particular this directory contains the codes for the following classifiers:
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Random Forest**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
